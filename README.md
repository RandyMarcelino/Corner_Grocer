# cplusplus-program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-The Corner Grocer App takes in a text file with a list of grocery item names that were bought for that day. Depending on the user choice to the menu from one to four where one produces a list of all items in the file and the frequency of the item by sending a query to python from C++. Option two prints out the frequency of single item by reaching out to Python via C++. Option three calls to Python from C++ to create a list of items in the file with their frequency then post that list to a new file called frequency.dat, then the C++ code reads the frequency.dat file and prints out the file histogram with the items and a * depiction of how many items there are.

What did you do particularly well?
-I personally did well in the C++ coding keeping it clean while still speaking with the Python code and making it function seemlessly. I also think I did well to make the C++ code given to me into inherited code and creating a header for it to be called so that the code wont clutter the main CPP file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-Where I could improve the code would be in the CPP i created the function to read the file but i could create a header and seperate CPP file so that it wont be involved in the main. Another fix I could do is clean the pythons code and create smaller portions to be called in the main functions that are called by CPP.
