# Corner_Grocer
The Corner Grocer App takes in a text file with a list of grocery item names that were bought for that day. Depending on the user choice to the menu from one to four where one produces a list of all items in the file and the frequency of the item by sending a query to python from C++. Option two prints out the frequency of single item by reaching out to Python via C++. Option three calls to Python from C++ to create a list of items in the file with their frequency then post that list to a new file called frequency.dat, then the C++ code reads the frequency.dat file and prints out the file histogram with the items and a * depiction of how many items there are.
